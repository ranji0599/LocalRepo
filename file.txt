# On remote
1st a remote repository is created in github
2nd the link of remote repo created is copied using http
3rd we move on to Local


# On Local
cd ==> to change directory
cd.. ==>to come out of current directory
1st we need to clone remote repo onto local repo (git clone <link of remote repo copied>)

we create a file using mkdir <folder name>

1st step is when a file is created in local repo then ==> we must 1st add it  (git add .) to add all the files or (git add <filename>)
2nd need to check status (git status)
2nd then we need to commit it by giving proper message (git commit -m"A valid message regarding changes done in the file")
3rd we need to check status (git status)
4th we need to push it on to remote (git push origin main)

git init #used to create a new repo on local
git remote add orgin <link of remote repo copied in case thought of creating different repo or else existing repo link can also be used here>
git remote -v #to verify remote
git branch #to check branch
git branch -M main # to rename branch to main (main should be used as default as per git standards)
git push -u origin main # if u are working on same file and donot wish to type complete command we can make use of -u so that from next time onwards we can make use of only git push ==> every time it pushes on to origin main
